for now feature for each model node will be set as keys in a dict 

either all feature (for first model predicting SF )
then 

below will give you selected features for this SF model to predict whihc family in this SF
feature_dict['Superfamily_code']['CHOROID_PLEX']


___________________________DONE DONT CHANGE_______________________________________


for def __init__(self, hierarchy_keys, hierarchy_levels, feature_keys, select_top_n_features):

"feature_keys" may be confusing for the user. for example they will need to do some sort of NOT targets calculation 
or if they want to upload the entire only feature part there isnt an option for that (e.g. slice(None))

possible forms of DF 

only contains features - user filterd out other variables already -- NOT POSSIBLE. we need the names of the labels to match and we dont want to risk any possability of them not matching by way of allowing targets and features to be passed in seperately. 

has targets,features and some meta data (realted to the user)-- very possible will need to ask the user to put in feature names, they can upload an excel or csv file for this and 

ok actualy yeah not a problem let user interface with a CSV or something this is much easier. keep it as is
